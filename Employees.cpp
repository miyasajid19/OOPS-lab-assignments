// 6. Write a program where each object of class Employee has a constant employee ID
// (assigned during construction) and a static member totalEmployees that tracks the number
// of employee objects created. Use a friend function to display the details of any Employee
// object, including the employee ID, and the total number of employees.
// Requirements:
// 1. The employee ID must be a const member initialized in the constructor.
// 2. The totalEmployees member should be static and updated with each new object
// creation.
// 3. Use a friend function to display an employeeâ€™s details and the total number of
// employees.
// 4. Use the scope resolution operator to access the static member in the main function.
