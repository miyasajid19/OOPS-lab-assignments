/*
You are tasked with designing a program to model the behavior of an online store that tracks the number of orders placed by all customers.
Requirements:
1. Create a class Order that contains:
    - A private member orderID (int) to store the orderâ€™s unique identifier.
    - A private static member totalOrders (int) that keeps track of the total number of orders placed.
    - A constructor that initializes orderID and increments the totalOrders by 1 whenever a new order is placed.
    - A static function getTotalOrders() that returns the total number of orders placed so far.
2. In the main() function:
    - Create multiple Order objects to simulate new orders being placed.
    - Display the unique orderID for each order and the total number of orders after each order is placed using the getTotalOrders() static function.
Tasks:
    - Implement the Order class.
    - Use static members to track the total number of orders across all objects.
    - Write a main() function to demonstrate the use of static members and functions.
